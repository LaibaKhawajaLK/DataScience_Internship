Task 2: Sentiment Analysis

 ML Approach (Logistic Regression & Naïve Bayes)
- Contains traditional NLP-based sentiment analysis using TF-IDF.
- Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Confusion matrices included.

DL Approach (LSTM Model)
- Implemented an LSTM-based deep learning model for sentiment classification.
- Used word embeddings & sequence padding.
- Compared results with ML models.

Files Included:
- `ML_Approach.ipynb` → Machine Learning-based approach
- `DL_Approach.ipynb` → Deep Learning-based approach
- `visualization1.png` → Confusion Matrix (ML)
- `visualization2.png` → Confusion Matrix & Accuracy/Loss plot (DL)

How to Run:
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open `ML_Approach.ipynb` or `DL_Approach.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to see results.
